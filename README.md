# QUIZ PROYECT

This is a fun little quiz game. In this project we put into practice what we have learned about SPA, APIs, HTML and CSS.

The project has axios calls to get the questions through API calls. It has a start button to start the game, every time this button is pressed a call is made that returns 10 different general knowledge questions. 

When you finish answering the questions you can choose between retrying or knowing the result of your game.
